This is the J2ME/Cibyl branch of Sarien. The main branch has been
merged into ScummVM, http://scummvm.org, so I have not bothered with
keeping this branch compatible with main. The webpage for Sarien/J2ME
is http://spel.bth.se/index.php/Sarien_for_Cibyl

To build Sarien/J2ME, setup Cibyl and run make.
